# Commuting in Munich: did petrol hybrids vs traditional diesel help in reducing my costs? could I improve trip times?

While living in Munich (Germany) between 2002 and 2018, I owned a small diesel car for several years before switching to a full hybrid in 2009 until 2018, when I left the country.

I started tracking, with increasing level of detail, my 18 km daily commute and fuel fill-ups to understand how and in which way would the two vehicle types compare, when factoring time of travel, weather (temperature), traffic patterns, etc. Also, I wanted to see if there was anything I could do to reduce commute time and costs.

I gathered the data in several Excel files over the years. I then consolidated, cleaned up and analyzed them in Power BI.
The results are available [here.](https://github.com/pakitt/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/fueltracking/Fuel%20consumption%20tracking.pbix)

## Data gathered daily from 2002 till 2018
1350+ data points, including:
- commute times to/from work
- fuel prices
- fuel consumption (reported by the Multi Function Display (MFD) on all three vehicles
- ambient temperature at destination 
- route taken to/from work
- average speed
- accuracy of MFD - not part of this report (on average all three cars are about 5% optimistic)
- overall Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) - not part of this report

## Reasons for tracking and analysis:
- Will a petrol hybrid vehicle used to commute in city traffic save me money on fuel vs a diesel powered vehicle? (Yes!)
- How will time of day affect my commute time?
- Which route is the best to/from work?
- Which day of the week is the best/worst to commute?
- Will the Prius 4th Generation offer significant advantage in terms of fuel consumption vs the Prius 3rd Generation?
- Will summer and winter tyres have any significant influence on fuel consumption, considering that traffic patterns change significantly between the two periods of the year?

### The three vehicles I owned:
