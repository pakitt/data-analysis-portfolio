## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me
After many years in the B2B technology sector, I began deepening my expertise in **data-driven decision making** — exploring how structured analysis, visualization, and clear metrics can guide better business and product outcomes.  

This repository highlights projects that reflect my analytical thinking, curiosity, and commitment to evidence-based insight generation.

## 📊 Featured Projects

- [**Hybrid Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Study**](https://github.com/pakitt/data-analysis-portfolio/tree/main/fueltracking)

  A long-term, self-initiated analysis designed to answer a practical question: *Was buying a hybrid car worth it?*  
  Using real-world data, I tracked and analyzed fuel consumption over time to evaluate efficiency under different temperatures, routes, and driving conditions.  
  Tools: Excel, statistical functions, and visual trend analysis.

- [**iOS App for EV Data and Cost Estimation**](https://github.com/pakitt/data-analysis-portfolio/tree/main/ios)
    
  A Swift-based prototype to calculate EV charging costs and compare efficiency metrics.  
  Developed as a personal project bridging my interest in technology, user experience, and applied data analytics.
