# An iOS app prototype: EV Companion

The [EV Compaion app](https://github.com/pakitt/data-analysis-portfolio/tree/main/ios/EV-Companion) is a working prototype I wrote in [Swift](https://www.swift.org/) and [Swift UI](https://developer.apple.com/swiftui/) in [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode), initally meant for iOS17 & iOS18, and now ported to [iOS26](https://developer.apple.com/ios/), adopting Apple's new [Liquid Glass UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGztGfRujSE).

The EV Companion app helps EV drivers answering questions like:
- how much is my charging session going to be?
- will I save money charging electricity at this price compared to my old gas vehicle?
- how big is my battery?

It offers also tools & utilties to:
- convert among different common EV and gas powered cars unit of measure (e.g., MPG, kWh/mi, L/100km...)
- estimate your EV battery's size based on a recent charge session (i.e., in case you are renting or cannot find the information in your car's manuals)
- set the fuel consumption and gas price of your old vehicle to see how it compares with the new EV you just bought - you might be surprised at how expensive electricity is sold at, at some provider's charging stations!

**Disclaimers**
- This app is a prototype and has limited funcionality: multi-currency support and metric system not yet implemented, bugs here and there.
- Everything you see is self-taught: learned coding using official Apple Developer's Swift and Swift UI documentation, Swift Playgrounds, Youtube videos, [CodeWithChris courses](https://codewithchris.com/), and code examples/ideas from ChatGPT. 
- **IMPORTANT NOTE about my experience using AI in coding**: a lot of the answers from ChatGPT were not helpful, as it is trained on old versions of Swift that changes yearly. Xcode has introduced AI support only *after* I stopped working on this prototype. AI is good for ideas, searches, and as a starting point, but not good for actual coding.
