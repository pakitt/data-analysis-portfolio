# An iOS app prototype: EV Companion 
## Problem statement
EV owners are often exposed to multiple efficiency metrics (kWh/100 km, km/kWh, cost/km) and variable charging prices depending on location and time of day.

This project explores how these variables can be combined into a simple, transparent interface that supports everyday cost and efficiency decisions.

The [EV Companion app](https://github.com/pakitt/data-analysis-portfolio/tree/main/ios/EV-Companion) is a working prototype written in [Swift](https://www.swift.org/) and [Swift UI](https://developer.apple.com/swiftui/) using [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) that addresses this problem.

## App features

- Input EV parameters: battery capacity, efficiency, route distance  
- Estimate charging costs based on electricity price assumptions  
- Compare common EV efficiency metrics  
- Simple visual output designed for clarity and transparency  
- Offline-first prototype (no external APIs)

---

## Technical notes

- Focus on clear data flow and deterministic calculations  
- UI designed to prioritize readability over visual complexity  
- No backend or live data integration (intentional scope limitation)
